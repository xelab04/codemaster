            The finals will comprise of down-to-earth questions set in a realistic scenario. We won't be asking you to implement a certain algorithm, but rather come up and code your own approach to the problem. There is no single right answer!

    <div class="QA">
        <div class="question">

        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Yes. The finals will require actual coding. Finalists will have to bring their [charged] laptops, or tablets. IDE's and development environments are the students' responsibilities.

            While we understand that professionals use these powerful tools to aid in coding, we will not allow access to the internet during the finals. This is to ensure fairness and that there is no remote teamwork through the internet.
